While running the main_AIO on the Pi, I noticed a couple of things.

If the threads are not killed when stop is entered, when you try to enter auto the second time, the program freezes.
I think it throws an error that the threads are already made and it just does not want to continue.

Secondly, the WiringPi's ISR thread is complaining that the ISR function thread is already called once.
Upon inspection, it seems that the pigpio is a better alternative for GPIO handling.
It seems that this library is quite well managed.
