Commands: auto | manual | stop | status | quit | help | clear

This control program has been implemented as a 3 state finite state machine
The 3 states are automatic control, manual control, and idle states

WE SHOULD AGREE UPON WHAT DOES THE IDLE STATE DO, DO WE KILL THREADS?

"auto" starts the automatic antenna control state
    Upon starting this program, the antenna first homes itself, after which it starts actively tracking the Sun.
    The program calculates the Sun's position using NASA's CSPICE library."
    The position of the stepper motor is tracked via an incremental encoder. A PID loop controls the speed of the stepper motor.
    The automatic control state can be checked via the "status" command - see "status" for more details.

"manual" starts the manual control state.
    If this state is selected while the antenna is actively tracking, the automatic tracking program is halted.
    This mode enables manual control of the antenna.
    jog lijevo desno, odredeni RA, oyu name it. ovisno o tome kako napisemo metodu.
    The position of the stepper motor is tracked via an incremental encoder. A PID loop controls the speed of the stepper motor.
    The manual control state can be checked via the "status" command - see "status" for more details.

"stop" stops the selected mode and the program is now in idle state.
    If this mode is selected while the antenna is actively tracking, the automatic tracking program is halted.

"status" shows the status of the mode the program is in.
    WRITE IT OUT FOR EVERY STATE.

"quit" gracefully quits the whole program, independent of the mode the program is in.
    If this mode is selected while the antenna is actively tracking, the program !should! write the last known position in a file

"clear" clears the console output.
